* We use a **Key Track System**:
  🔹 Each vehicle key has a **unique tag** and **electronic slot**.
  🔹 Always **sign in and out** using your assigned user code.
  🔹 **Double-check** that the correct key is pulled for the correct vehicle (scan if unsure).
  🔹 If a key is missing or not returning to its slot, report to your manager **immediately**.

## 🚗 **LOT PRESENTATION – What “Looking Good” Means**

**Daily Tasks:**

1. **Morning Sweep (Before Opening):**

   * Walk the full lot. Look for trash, debris, or leaves — remove all.
   * Straighten all cars — align bumpers and spacing evenly.
   * Check for vehicles blocking walkways or looking messy. Fix fast.

2. **Vehicle Checks:**

   * Make sure **stickers are visible** (window, pricing, and tags).
   * Remove any dead bugs, dust, or bird droppings with a clean cloth or quick rinse.
   * Check for flat tires or vehicle damage. Report it.

3. **Evening Reset (Before Closing):**

   * Bring any moved cars back to their row.
   * Ensure all **keys are returned to Key Track**.
   * Make a final walk-through to ensure a tidy, secure lot.

## 📅 **WEEKLY TOUCHES:**

* Power wash or rinse front row cars if dusty or rainy week.
* Rotate front display vehicles based on sales guidance.
* Help photo team stage cars for online listings.
* Assist service with overflow coordination if needed.

## 🧼 **CLEANLINESS CODE:**

* Keep trash cans empty and lot signs upright.
* Shine up showroom display vehicles if assigned.
* Wear clean, branded gear with pride — you represent the first impression!

## 🧭 **COMMUNICATION & TEAMWORK:**

* Check in with the **Sales Managers** and **Service Writers** daily:
  “Anything need moving, cleaned, or prepped for delivery?”
* Respond quickly to customer requests:
  “I’ll grab that car right now for you.” = Hero moment.
